	<h1>Guessing Game</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The user should have an input field where they can submit a guess.</li>
		<li>After the user submits a guess, indicate whether their guess is 'hot' or 'cold'.</li>
		<li>Feel free to use prompts to get user input on your first version. But, for the final version of your project, you'll need to create an HTML-based interface for getting user inputs and giving feedback on guesses.</li>
		<li>Create a new game button that resets the game.</li>
		<li>Store all of the guesses and create a way to check if the guess is a repeat.</li>
	</ul>
