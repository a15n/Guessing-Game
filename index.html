	<h1>Guessing Game</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>The user should have an input field where they can submit a guess.</li>
		<li>After the user submits a guess, indicate whether their guess is 'hot' or 'cold'.</li>
		<li>Let the user know if they need to guess higher or lower.</li>
		<li>Allow the user to guess only a certain amount of times. When they run out of guesses let them know the game is over.</li>
		<li>Feel free to use prompts to get user input on your first version.</li>
		<li>For the final version of your project, you'll need to create an HTML-based interface for getting user inputs and giving feedback on guesses.</li>
		<li>Validate inputs that they are real numbers between 1-100.</li>
		<li>Create a new game button that resets the game.</li>
		<li>Store all of the guesses and create a way to check if the guess is a repeat.</li>
		<li>Track the user's previous guess.</li>
		<li>Let them know if they are getting hotter or colder based on their previous guess.</li>
	</ul>
